## Contributing

After cloning this repository, install necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You can also use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### Executing tests

Before starting tests execution, you need to build the package. You can use `npm run build` in order to build the production-ready version
or `npm run develop` which produces a development version with attached watcher for all sources files.

```bash
npm run test -- [additional options]
# or
npm t -- [additional options]
```

The command accepts the following options:

* `--coverage` (`-c`) &ndash; Whether to generate the code coverage.
* `--source-map` (`-s`) &ndash; Whether to attach the source maps.
* `--watch` (`-w`) &ndash; Whether to watch test files.
* `--reporter` (`-r`) &ndash; Reporter for Karma (default: `mocha`, can be changed to `dots`).
* `--browsers` (`-b`) &ndash; Browsers that will be used to run tests (default: `Chrome`, available: `Firefox`).

### Building the package

Build a minified version of the package that is ready to publish:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Releasing package

This package's release process is automated via CircleCI. Before you start a new release, you'll need to prepare the changelog entries.

1. Make sure the `#master` branch is up-to-date: `git fetch && git checkout master && git pull`.
1. Prepare a release branch: `git checkout -b release-[YYYY-MM-DD]` where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the current day.
1. Generate the changelog entries: `yarn run changelog --branch release-[YYYY-MM-DD]`.
    * This task checks what changed in each package and bumps the version accordingly. If nothing changes at all, it won't create a new changelog entry. If changes were irrelevant (e.g., only dependencies), it would make an "internal changes" entry.
    * Scan the logs printed by the tool to search for errors (incorrect changelog entries). Incorrect entries (e.g., ones without the type) should be addressed. You may need to create entries for them manually. This is done directly in CHANGELOG.md (in the root directory). Make sure to verify the proposed version after you modify the changelog.
1. Commit all changes and prepare a new pull request targeting the `#master` branch.
1. Ping the @ckeditor/ckeditor-5-devops team to review the pull request and trigger the release process.
