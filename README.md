## Contributing

After cloning this repository, install necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You can also use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### Running the development server

To manually test the editor integration with different versions of React, you can start the development server using one of the commands below:

```bash
npm run dev:16 # Open the demo projects using React 16.
npm run dev:18 # Open the demo projects using React 18.
npm run dev:19 # Open the demo projects using React 19.
```

### Executing tests

To test the editor integration against a set of automated tests, run the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

If you want to run the tests in watch mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Building the package

To build the package that is ready to publish, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Releasing package

CircleCI automates the release process and can release both channels: stable (`X.Y.Z`) and pre-releases (`X.Y.Z-alpha.X`, etc.).

Before you start, you need to prepare the changelog entries.

1. Make sure the `#master` branch is up-to-date: `git fetch && git checkout master && git pull`.
1. Prepare a release branch: `git checkout -b release-[YYYYMMDD]` where `YYYYMMDD` is the current day.
1. Generate the changelog entries: `yarn run release:prepare-changelog`.
	* You can specify the release date by passing the `--date` option, e.g., `--date=2025-06-11`.
	* By passing the `--dry-run` option, you can check what the script will do without actually modifying the files.
	* Read all the entries, correct poor wording and other issues, wrap code names in backticks to format them, etc.
	* Add the missing `the/a` articles, `()` to method names, "it's" -> "its", etc.
	* A newly introduced feature should have just one changelog entry â€“ something like "The initial implementation of the FOO feature." with a description of what it does.
1. Commit all changes and prepare a new pull request targeting the `#master` branch.
1. Ping the `@ckeditor/ckeditor-5-platform` team to review the pull request and trigger the release process.
